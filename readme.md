An API built with php(Laravel) for two mobile applications the first would be used by the owner of the organization and the second would be used
by the staffs.
 The whole concept is simply monitoring your staffs with things like facial recognition,salary management,task assignement,
 tasks execution,push notifications on staff login and some other cool stuffs :)
